    "The ultimate goal of the project is to create a pricing model to predict the value of a laptop based on its features. In this step, we make sure we clean, organize, and make the dataset friendly to analysis.\n",

    "While there exists a cleaned dataset in the download, the goal is to explore this data on our own and we will be cleaning the dataset that has not been cleaned by someone else."
